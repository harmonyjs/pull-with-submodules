/**
 * @fileoverview Barrel for shared utility modules (errors, async, fs, git helpers).
 *
 * Purpose: central import point for cross-cutting helpers used by core, UI and
 * orchestration layers. Keeps consumer import paths stable while internal
 * module set evolves.
 *
 * Currently empty â€“ concrete utility modules will be added incrementally.
